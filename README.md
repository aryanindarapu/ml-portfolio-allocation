# Machine Learning Portfolio Allocation Tool
This project aims to be a culmination of classical machine learning theory by merging portfolio optimization techniques with regressive asset return models. Here, the following portfolio allocation formulations are implemented:
- Equal Weighted Portfolio
- Inverse Volatility Portfolio
- Global Minimum Variance Portfolio
- Mean-Variance (Markowitz) Portfolio
- Naive Risk Budgeting Portfolio (diagonal assumption)
- Risk Parity Portfolio (no diagonal assumption)
- Sharpe Ratio Maximization

Additionally, the following asset return models are implemented:
- CAPM Model
- Fama-French Three Factor Model
- Fama-French Five Factor Model

### Update: Nov 29, 2024
- The project now has a React frontend and FastAPI backend.
